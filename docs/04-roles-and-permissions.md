# 04 — Roles and Permissions

**Roles:** `admin` (Administrator), `owner` (Vlasnik), `manager` (Menadžer), `receptionist` (Recepcioner). Trainers and members have no accounts.

> The `admin` role was added by D-58 on 18.09.2026. **An admin has every permission an owner has**, so the Owner column below also describes the admin unless a row says otherwise. Rows P-03, P-04, P-06 and P-07 state where the two differ.

> ASSUMPTION (AS-5): Managers can manage manager and receptionist accounts, but never owner accounts. Only owners create owners.

## 2. Enforcement
1. **Database first.**
   - Every table has Row Level Security enabled.
   - The `authenticated` role has **no direct INSERT, UPDATE or DELETE** on business tables.
   - Every write goes through a `security definer` Postgres function (RPC) that checks role, gym and shift rules and raises a coded error when a rule is broken.
   - Reads are limited by RLS SELECT policies (doc 07 §6).
2. **Financial fields live in owner-only tables.**
   - `plan_finance`, `membership_finance` and `trainer_finance` hold them.
   - Owner reports are `security definer` functions that start with an owner check.
   - Managers and receptionists can never receive these values, even through the API directly.
   - The one exception is D-80: `fin_summary`, `fin_income_breakdown`, `fin_expenses` and `fin_shifts` start with `assert_finance_period`, which also admits a manager for today, this week or this month, and then return income, non-salary expenses and shift totals only. Profit, bar profit, the cost of goods sold, the income statement and cash flow (`fin_statement`, D-92), stock value, salaries, trainer shares and shift reports never reach a manager.
3. **UI.**
   - Navigation and buttons are shown only when the role may use them.
   - Server components also check the role and return 404 for pages the role may not open.
4. **Staff account actions** (create user, set password, deactivate) run in server actions with the Supabase service-role key, after checking the caller's role. The service-role key is **never** sent to the browser.
5. **Deactivated staff:**
   - `staff.is_active = false`, and the Supabase Auth user is banned;
   - existing sessions are rejected on the next request;
   - history is kept.
6. **Tests.** Every row in §1 marked ✗ has an automated test proving the database rejects the action (doc 08 §10).
