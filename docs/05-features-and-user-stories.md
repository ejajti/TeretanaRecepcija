# 05 — Features and User Stories

All features are **MVP**. Acceptance criteria (AC) are written so each one can be tested. Rules are referenced by ID; the rule text in doc 03 is authoritative.

---

## F-01 Staff accounts and login
**US-01.1** As a member of staff, I log in with my username and password so I can work without an email address (D-57).
- AC1: The login form (S-01) has "Korisničko ime ili email" and "Lozinka".
- AC2: Input without `@` is treated as a username. Input with `@` is treated as an email.
- AC3: Wrong credentials show `Pogrešno korisničko ime/email ili lozinka.` The message does not reveal which one was wrong.
- AC4: A deactivated user cannot log in and sees the same message.
- AC5: Every role signs in this way. Only the admin, and the seeded owner account, sign in with an email (D-57).
- AC6: After 5 failed sign-ins in a row for the same username or email (within 15 minutes, with no successful sign-in between), that login is locked for 15 minutes (D-75). While it is locked, every attempt shows `Previše neuspješnih pokušaja prijave. Pokušajte ponovo za <N> min.`, and the password is not checked at all, so even the right one is refused. A username or email that belongs to nobody is counted and locked the same way, so the message reveals no account (AC3). The failed attempts themselves still show the AC3 message, with no count of attempts left.
- AC7: After 30 failed sign-ins in 15 minutes from one client address, every sign-in from that address is refused for 15 minutes with the AC6 message (D-75).
- AC8: The password field has an eye button, `Prikaži lozinku` / `Sakrij lozinku`, that shows or hides what was typed. Every other password field in the app has it too (D-82).

**US-01.2** As the admin, I log in with my email, and I can reset a forgotten password by email (D-57, D-58).
- AC1: "Zaboravljena lozinka?" sends a reset link only to an account that has an email, which is the admin and the seeded owner account.
- AC2: For a username, it shows `Lozinku vam postavlja administrator, vlasnik ili menadžer.`
- AC3: The link in the email works once, in any browser and on any device. It opens S-01b, which asks only for the new password; after saving, the user lands on their home screen (D-69).

**US-01.3** As an owner or manager, I create and manage staff accounts (S-23).
- AC1: Creating a receptionist requires full name, username (`^[a-z0-9._]{3,30}$`, unique) and a temporary password (≥ 8 characters).
- AC2: Creating a manager or owner requires full name, username and a temporary password, exactly like a receptionist. Creating an admin requires an email instead of a username. Only an admin can create an owner or another admin (P-03, D-58).
- AC3: A user created with a temporary password must set a new password at first login (S-01b) before any other screen.
- AC4: Owners and managers can set a new temporary password for receptionists and managers. Only an admin can do it for owners and admins. The admin can additionally read every stored staff password (P-06, D-59).
- AC5: Deactivating a user bans them in Supabase Auth. Their next request redirects to login. Nobody may deactivate their own account, and the last active owner or admin cannot be deactivated (P-07, D-60).
- AC6: A login locked by US-01.1 AC6 shows `Zaključan do <HH:mm>` on S-23. The owner and the admin can lift the lock early with [Otključaj], which also clears the failed attempts; for owner and admin accounts only the admin can. Both the lock and the unlock are recorded in Dnevnik izmjena (P-08, D-75).

**US-01.4** As any user, I change my own password from the user menu.
- AC1: The current password is required, the new one must be ≥ 8 characters, and a success toast appears. S-01b after a first login (AS-18) or a reset link (D-69) does not ask for it.

## F-02 Shifts
**US-02.1** As a receptionist, a shift opens automatically when I log in (BR-111).
- AC1: With no open shift in the gym, logging in creates a shift with me as owner and `started_at` = now.
- AC2: If the open shift is mine, logging in resumes it and no new shift is created.
- AC3: The header always shows `Smjena: <ime> od <HH:mm>`.

**US-02.2** As a receptionist, I can take over a shift someone forgot to close.
- AC1: S-02 appears when another receptionist's shift is open.
- AC2: [Preuzmi smjenu] closes the other shift (`takeover`, optional counted cash), queues its report, and opens mine, all in one transaction.
- AC3: [Odjavi se] logs me out without changes.

**US-02.3** As an owner or manager, my money actions go into the open shift (BR-092).
- AC1: With no open shift, every money button is disabled and shows the BR-092 message on hover and click.
- AC2: A record I create shows me as "Unio/la" (entered by) in the shift report.
- AC3: A manager can read the currently open shift's cash income, card income, till expenses and expected cash on S-12 and through `shift_summary`. The response contains only these totals; requests for closed shifts or another gym are rejected (D-54). Expense details still follow BR-134.

**US-02.4** As a receptionist, I can log out without closing my shift (BR-113). The confirmation dialog is shown first.

## F-03 Member cards
**US-03.1** As an owner, I generate a batch of unassigned cards and print them (S-28). A manager may not (D-81).
- AC1: Quantity 1–100. The codes follow BR-030 and are unique.
- AC2: The PDF matches the S-28 layout. Printing it at 100 % scale gives cards of 85.6 × 54 mm.
- AC3: The batch list shows date, quantity, how many are still unassigned, and a [Preuzmi PDF] button.

## F-04 Card scan: check-in and check-out
**US-04.1** As a receptionist, scanning a card does the right thing automatically (BR-070).
- AC1: Every row of the BR-070 table produces exactly the described result and message.
- AC2: From the moment Enter is received to the result on screen takes ≤ 1 s (p95) (doc 08 §9).
- AC3: A scan is captured whenever S-03 is open and no text input or dialog other than the result dialogs has focus (S-03 scan capture rules).

**US-04.2** As a receptionist, checking in a member whose memberships cover a single visit type takes one scan and zero clicks (BR-073, D-102).
- AC1: Teretana only: the green dialog (BR-079) appears, the visit is saved with type `gym`, and the covering membership (BR-074) is linked, also when two gym memberships cover today.
- AC2: Grupni only, at their class: the visit is saved with type `group`, the membership's trainer and the class. Outside their class: an unpaid gym visit with the yellow or red dialog.
- AC3: Personalni only: the visit is saved with type `personal` and the membership's trainer. With the sessions used up (Grupni or Personalni), the visit is unpaid and the yellow or red dialog appears.

**US-04.3** As a receptionist, I choose the visit type when the member's memberships cover two or more visit types, such as G+T (BR-073–076).
- AC1: The buttons, preselection, trainer list, trainer default and slot default follow BR-073–076.
- AC2: Enter confirms. Esc cancels, and nothing is saved.
- AC3: When two memberships cover the type, a membership selector appears with the earliest-ending one preselected.

**US-04.4** As a receptionist, I am clearly warned about unpaid visits (BR-079).
- AC1: N = 1 shows the yellow dialog with the warning sound. N ≥ 2 shows the full-screen red dialog with the alarm sound.
- AC2: [Produži članarinu] opens S-08 for that member.

**US-04.5** As a receptionist, scanning the card again checks the member out (BR-072).
- AC1: A toast shows the name and duration.
- AC2: A scan within the double-scan guard time asks for confirmation first.
- AC3: A scan at most 60 minutes after an automatic check-out checks the member out at that moment instead of in, with the same toast (BR-072a, D-74).

**US-04.6** As the gym, a member who forgets to scan out leaves "U teretani" on their own (BR-082a, D-74).
- AC1: 1 h 30 min after check-in the visit is checked out automatically, at check-in + 1 h 30 min, and the row leaves the list at the next refresh.

## F-05 Manual check-in/out and "U teretani"
**US-05.1** As a receptionist, I check in a member who forgot their card by searching name, phone or number.
- AC1: The search is on S-03 and follows BR-044. Choosing a result starts the same flow as a scan, with `is_manual = true`.

**US-05.2** As a receptionist, I see everyone currently in the gym and can check anyone out.
- AC1: The "U teretani" list shows name, member number, visit type, check-in time and live duration (updated every minute; the list itself is reloaded every 5 minutes while visible, D-85), sorted by check-in time.
- AC2: [Odjavi] checks that member out and the row disappears.
- AC3: The header of the list shows the count and today's total visits.

## F-06 Member registration
**US-06.1** As a receptionist, scanning an empty card opens registration and I sign the member up in one form (S-05).
- AC1: The fields and validation follow BR-040–043, and the membership part follows F-08.
- AC2: Save creates the member, assigns the card, creates the membership and payment and, if "Prijavi odmah" is checked (default), checks the member in, all in **one transaction**. If anything fails, nothing is saved. The visit is recorded as a scan would record it (BR-073, D-102), without a question; a new G+T member is checked in to the gym.
- AC3: After saving, a notice shows `Upišite ime olovkom na karticu: <Ime Prezime> (#<broj>)`.
- AC4: [Novi član] on S-06 opens the same form with a "Skenirajte praznu karticu" field. Save is disabled until a valid unassigned card has been scanned.

## F-07 Member list, profile, edit, anonymization
**US-07.1** As staff, I search and list members (S-06).
- AC1: The search follows BR-044. Results show number, name, phone, the current status summary and the last visit date.
- AC2: 25 results per page.

**US-07.2** As staff, I open a member's profile (S-07) with personal data, card, memberships (status, dates, remaining sessions, trainer), payments I am allowed to see, and visit history.
- AC1: Memberships are sorted by `end_date` descending, and each shows its BR-054 status label.
- AC2: Visit history shows 20 visits per page with date, check-in and check-out times, type, trainer, and a "Neplaćeno" badge where applicable.

**US-07.3** As staff, I edit personal data (BR-045). The change appears in the audit log.

**US-07.4** As the owner, I anonymize a member (BR-046) after typing the member number to confirm.

## F-08 Selling and renewing memberships
**US-08.1** As staff, I sell a membership (S-08) from the profile, a warning dialog, or registration.
- AC1: The plan list shows active plans, excluding the day pass.
- AC2: The start date, reason text and last valid day are calculated by BR-052 and BR-051 and shown before saving.
- AC3: A trainer is required when BR-058 applies, and the list follows BR-023.
- AC4: The amount is read-only for list-price plans (editable for the owner). Personalni has no amount field: the gym's fixed part is its amount, required and ≥ the minimum (BR-059, D-101), and the session count (1–50) is required.
- AC5: The payment method is required. Save runs in one transaction (BR-060) and links unpaid visits per BR-052.
- AC6: With no open shift, Save is disabled (BR-092), except in the owner's back-dated mode.

**US-08.2** As staff, [Produži] on a membership opens S-08 with the same plan and trainer preselected.

## F-09 Membership status and session counting
**US-09.1** Status and remaining sessions everywhere follow BR-053–055 and always reflect the latest data.

## F-10 Unpaid visits and warnings
Covered by US-04.4, BR-078 and BR-079.

**US-10.1** As staff, the profile shows the count of unlinked unpaid visits as a red badge `Neplaćeni dolasci: N`.

## F-11 Lost card replacement
**US-11.1** As staff, I replace a lost card (BR-034) via [Izgubljena kartica] on S-07.
- AC1: The dialog shows the fee and asks for the method, then asks to scan an unassigned card.
- AC2: Scanning a card that is not unassigned shows its BR-070 message, and the dialog stays open.

## F-12 Day passes
**US-12.1** As staff, I sell day passes (BR-100) with [Dnevna karta] on S-03.
- AC1: A quantity stepper (1–20), the live total, and the method. After saving, a toast shows `Prodato: <N> × dnevna karta = <iznos>`.

## F-13 Payment correction and voiding
**US-13.1** As staff, I see and correct the current shift's records on S-12 (BR-094, BR-095).
- AC1: The list shows today's payments and sales (non-back-dated), newest first. Records outside the open shift are read-only for non-owners.
- AC2: [Ispravi] allows changing the method and note (and the amount for the owner). [Poništi] requires a reason of 3–200 characters.
- AC3: Voiding a membership payment shows a confirmation that the membership will be voided and its visits become unpaid.

## F-14 Desk cash expenses
**US-14.1** As staff, I record an expense with [Trošak] on S-03, on the same form as S-17 [Novi trošak] (BR-132, BR-133, D-98).
- AC1: After saving, the expense appears in S-12 "Moji troškovi danas" and in the shift summary.

## F-15 Magacin
**US-15.1** As staff, I record a sale (BR-142) and new goods (BR-141) on S-13.
- AC1: The stock level updates immediately after saving.
- AC2: The sale quantity cannot exceed stock (E17).
- AC3: Stock-in with "Iz kase" reduces expected cash (E18).
- AC4: Stock-in with a zero or negative purchase price is rejected by both the form and the RPC, without creating a stock movement or an expense. The minimum purchase price is €0.01 (D-55).

**US-15.2** As the owner, I manage products and see stock value and bar profit (S-20).
- AC1 (D-76): The owner, the admin and the manager add products with [Dodaj proizvod] and edit them with [Uredi] on S-13 Magacin, and bring back deactivated ones under [Prikaži neaktivne]. A receptionist sees neither. There is no separate products screen.
- AC2 (D-92): For a chosen period S-20 shows per product the purchase and sale price, what came in (pieces and €), what was sold, its income, its cost of goods sold, Bruto zarada and Marža, the adjustments in pieces and Manjak robe (D-103), and the stock and its value at the end of the period (BR-159), with a totals row (E23, E24).

**US-15.3 (D-103)** As the owner, the admin or the manager, I correct the stock level to what I counted on the shelf (BR-145) on S-13.
- AC1: Every product row has [Poravnaj stanje] for the owner, the admin and the manager, and not for a receptionist, whom `adjust_stock` also refuses (P-45).
- AC2: The dialog shows `Stanje u aplikaciji: <N>`, takes `Prebrojano stanje` and shows `Razlika: -5 (manjak)` or `Razlika: +2 (višak)` while typing; with no difference it says `Prebrojano stanje je isto kao stanje u aplikaciji.` and [Sačuvaj] stays disabled.
- AC3: Goods found offer only Višak pri popisu and Ostalo, with the reminder to enter a delivery through Nova roba. Ostalo needs a note of 3–200 characters.
- AC4: A count made while a sale or a stock-in changed the stock is refused with E_STOCK_CHANGED, nothing is written, and the dialog shows the stock level now.
- AC5 (E26): after five of ten bags of whey at €28 are counted short, S-13 shows 5, the owner's `Bilans uspjeha` shows `Manjak robe` 140,00 € with gross profit and profit €140 lower, the cash flow is unchanged, the stock value is €140 lower, and S-20 lists the adjustment. The owner's [Poništi] there puts the five bags back.

## F-16 Shift close and report
**US-16.1** As a receptionist, I close my shift (BR-114) on S-14.
- AC1: The summary numbers equal BR-115. This is tested with E15.
- AC2: Counted cash is required. The difference appears live as "Manjak" or "Višak".
- AC3: After confirming: the shift is closed, the PDF is stored, the email is sent or queued, and I am logged out and shown `Smjena je zaključena.` on S-01.
- AC4: If the email fails, closing still succeeds (BR-118).

## F-17 Owner finance dashboard
**US-17.1** As the owner, I see income, expenses and profit for a chosen period (S-16).
- AC1: The period presets are Danas, Ova sedmica (Monday–Sunday), Ovaj mjesec, Prošli mjesec, Ova godina, plus a custom range. The default is Ovaj mjesec.
- AC2: The numbers follow BR-150–153 and have breakdowns by plan and method; expenses by category are the statement's operating expenses (AC4). The Troškovi card is the cost of goods sold, Manjak robe (D-103) and the operating expenses, so a stock-in is not a cost of its month (D-92).
- AC3: The page also shows:
  - a bar chart of income vs expenses for one calendar year, month by month, opening on the current year; its own filter picks an earlier year or narrows the chart to one month, day by day, with that year's or month's totals under it (D-68);
  - active members (count of members with at least one Aktivna membership today);
  - memberships expiring in the next 7 days (list);
  - members with unlinked unpaid visits (list).
- AC4 (D-92): Under the cards, `Bilans uspjeha` shows income by group (Članarine, Treninzi, Prodaja iz magacina, Ostalo), `Trošak prodate robe`, `Bruto dobit`, operating expenses by category and `Profit`. `Novčani tok` shows Primljeno, Plaćena nova roba, Ostala plaćanja and Neto promjena novca (BR-158), and under it the stock value at the end of the period (BR-159). Profit is the same on the card, in the statement and under the chart (E25).

**US-17.2** As a manager, I see the gym's income and expenses for today, this week or this month, without profit or salaries (D-80).
- AC1: Finansije shows me only Pregled, Troškovi and Smjene. The period offers only Danas, Ova sedmica and Ovaj mjesec (default Ovaj mjesec); every other period is refused by the database.
- AC2: Pregled shows the Prihod and Troškovi cards and the breakdowns by plan, method and category. Troškovi and the category breakdown leave out salary categories. There is no Profit, Zarada na magacinu, active-member count, chart or member list.
- AC3: Troškovi (S-17) lists the period's non-salary expenses, with its filters and `Ukupno`, read-only.
- AC4: Smjene (S-19) lists the period's shifts with their totals, without the email status, the PDF, [Pošalji ponovo] or [Zaključi smjenu].

## F-18 Owner expenses and categories
**US-18.1** As the owner, I record any expense (BR-133) and see all expenses with filters for period, category, method and "entered by" (S-17).
- AC1 (D-63): the screen shows `Ukupno: <iznos>` for the listed expenses, voided ones excluded, and the total follows every change of period or filter.
- AC2 (D-104, E27): the form has `Datum plaćanja` and `Trošak za mjesec`, which offers the month of the date first and the 12 months before it, and follows the date (today from the till). An expense for an earlier month is that month's cost in `Bilans uspjeha`, the Troškovi and Profit cards, the chart and S-18's Isplaćeno, and the payment of its own day in `Novčani tok`. S-17 lists it by the day paid with `Za mjesec: <mjesec godina>` under the date. Every role has the field, at the desk too. A wrong month is corrected by voiding and entering the expense again.

**US-18.2** As the owner, I manage categories (BR-131) with [Kategorije troškova].

**US-18.3** As the owner, I describe the costs that repeat every month — rent, internet, salaries — once, and they are posted as expenses on the 1st of every month (BR-136, S-30, D-93).
- AC1: S-30 lists the active fixed expenses with Naziv, Kategorija, Iznos, Način, Od mjeseca and Zadnje knjiženje, and above them `Mjesečno ukupno` with Plate and the other fixed expenses apart. Inactive ones are under [Prikaži neaktivne (N)].
- AC2: [Dodaj fiksni trošak] and [Uredi] open the BR-136 form. `Od mjeseca` offers this month or later, and is locked once something was posted.
- AC3: A fixed expense added for this month is posted at once, dated the 1st; every later month is posted by the 00:05 job on the 1st. A month is posted once, even if its expense is voided.
- AC4: A posted expense appears on S-17 with the badge `Fiksni` and counts like any other expense on S-16. A change applies from the next month; posted expenses keep their amount.
- AC5: A manager and a receptionist get 404 on S-30 and `E_FORBIDDEN` from its RPCs.

## F-19 Trainer statistics and payouts
**US-19.1** As the owner, I see BR-156 metrics per trainer for a chosen month (S-18).
- AC1: Undefined shares are shown as "nije definisano" (E12).
- AC2: [Evidentiraj isplatu] opens the S-17 expense form prefilled with category Plate, the trainer, and the amount = Razlika (editable).

## F-20 Visit statistics
**US-20.1** As an owner or manager, I see visit statistics for a period (S-15):
- visits per day (bar chart);
- visits per hour of day (bar chart, 06–23);
- visits by type;
- average visit duration (excluding automatic check-outs);
- the top 10 members by visits.

## F-21 Settings: plans, prices, gym
**US-21.1** As the owner, I edit plans (S-25), other prices and gym settings (S-27), and upload the logo (PNG or JPG, ≤ 1 MB). Every change is audited.
- AC1: Changing a price does not change existing records (BR-004).
- AC2: A plan cannot be deleted, only deactivated.

## F-22 Settings: trainers, programs, schedule
**US-22.1** As an owner or manager, I manage trainers, programs, the trainer × program assignment matrix and the weekly schedule (S-24), following BR-023–026.
- AC1: An assignment is saved when its checkbox is toggled.
- AC2: A slot can only be created with a trainer assigned to its program.
- AC3: Trainer fee fields are visible to owners only.

**US-22.2 (D-72, D-105)** As any staff role, I see on S-29 Treneri which members are assigned to which trainer, on the tabs `Grupni` (BR-027) and `Personalni` (BR-027a), without opening each member's profile.
- AC1: `/trainers` opens on `Grupni`, the roster of D-72; [Personalni] opens `/trainers?tab=personalni`.
- AC2: `Personalni` lists per trainer the personal memberships valid today or starting later, with `Datum uplate`, `Važi do` and `Preostalo termina`; one that starts later shows `Počinje <datum>.`; a used-up one stays with `0 od <n>`; an expired, voided or group membership is not listed.
- AC3: Every active trainer of an active personal program is shown, with `Nema personalnih članova.` when they have none.
- AC4: Only the owner and the admin see `Cijena po članu (€)` and `UKUPNO – <trener>` (BR-157).

## F-23 Back-dated entries
**US-23.1** As the owner, I enter past visits, membership sales, day passes and card replacement payments (S-22, BR-120). Each record shows a "Naknadno" badge wherever it is listed.

## F-24 Audit log
**US-24.1** As the owner, I browse the audit log (S-21), filtered by period, user and record type. Each row shows the time, the user, the action, and a readable old → new comparison.

## F-25 Expiry reminder email
**US-25.1** As a member, I get an email 3 days before my membership ends (BR-160), using the doc 08 §7 template.

## F-26 Nightly job
**US-26.1** At 23:00 open visits are closed and the open shift is closed, and its report is sent (BR-162). Tested with E20.

## F-28 Weekly automatic backup
**US-28.1** As the developer, I receive an encrypted backup of all gym data every week (BR-163).
- AC1: Every Sunday after 03:00 gym time, exactly one backup is created; running the job again the same day does nothing.
- AC2: The ZIP opens only with `BACKUP_ZIP_PASSWORD` and contains one CSV per table plus `manifest.json` with correct row counts.
- AC3: The ZIP is stored in the `backups` bucket; after the 9th backup, the oldest is deleted.
- AC4: The email arrives at every address in `backup_emails`, with the ZIP attached (or the "too large" note).
- AC5: A failed run is retried up to 3 times that day, and S-27 shows `Posljednja rezervna kopija: <dd.mm.yyyy HH:mm> – uspješno/neuspješno`.

## F-27 Offline banner
**US-27.1** As staff, I immediately see when the internet is down.
- AC1: When the browser reports offline, or 2 consecutive requests fail with network errors, a red banner is shown across the top: `Nema internet konekcije. Podaci se ne mogu sačuvati – vodite evidenciju na papiru i predajte je vlasniku.`
- AC2: While the banner is shown, all save buttons are disabled.
- AC3: The banner disappears within 5 s after connectivity returns.
