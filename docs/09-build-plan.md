# 09 — Build Plan

Build the milestones **in order**. For every milestone:
1. Read the listed documents.
2. Implement only the listed scope.
3. Run all checks (`lint`, `typecheck`, `test`, `test:db`, `test:e2e`).
4. Confirm every "Done when" item.
5. **Stop and report to Mihajlo.** The report covers what was built, test results, deviations, and new questions.

Do not start the next milestone until he approves.

## M-00 Project setup
**Read:** 08.

**Tasks:**
- Next.js (App Router, TypeScript strict), Tailwind, shadcn/ui, ESLint + Prettier.
- Supabase CLI project configuration for hosted Supabase, `@supabase/ssr` clients (`lib/supabase/*`). No Docker or local database (D-56).
- Vitest, Playwright, pgTAP setup; run pgTAP directly against hosted Postgres with the transactional Node runner (D-56).
- npm scripts from 08 §10.
- `.env.example` with every variable from 08 §11.
- Security headers.
- `lib/format.ts`, `lib/phone.ts`, `lib/errors.ts`, `lib/i18n/me.ts` (skeletons).

**Done when:**
- `npm run dev` shows a placeholder page.
- All 5 check commands run and pass (with sample tests).
- Vitest covers BR-002, BR-003 and BR-041 examples.

## M-01 Database foundation
**Read:** 03 §1, 04 §2, 07 §1–4, 07 §6.

**Tasks:**
- Enums.
- Tables: `gyms`, `gym_settings`, `staff`, `shifts`, `member_counters`, `audit_log`, `job_runs`.
- Helper functions: `current_staff`, `my_role`, `my_gym`, `gym_today`, `gym_local_date`, `open_shift`.
- RLS for these tables; the audit trigger function.
- Seed step 1 and `scripts/seed-owner.ts`.

**Done when:**
- After inspecting the hosted project, apply the new migrations and seed data without resetting the database; `npm run seed:owner` creates Matija idempotently (D-56).
- pgTAP: `gym_today` returns the Podgorica date around midnight UTC.
- RLS tests for `staff` and `shifts` pass.

## M-02 Authentication and staff accounts (F-01)
**Read:** 04, 05 F-01, 06 S-01, S-01b, S-23, 08 §4.

**Tasks:**
- Login with username or email.
- Middleware (session refresh, inactive user check, `must_change_password`).
- `(app)/layout.tsx` with role-based navigation and header.
- S-23 with the staff admin actions.
- Own password change.
- Forgot-password link for owner and manager.

**Done when:**
- E2E: the owner logs in and is forced to change the password; the owner creates a manager and a receptionist; the receptionist logs in with a username; the manager cannot create an owner; a deactivated user is logged out on the next request.

## M-02b Admin role and username logins (D-57 to D-60)
**Read:** 04, 06 S-01, S-23, 07 §2–3 and §6, 08 §4, 10 (D-57 to D-60).

**Tasks:**
- Add the `admin` value to `app_role`; relax the `staff` identity check to one login identity per account, with an email required for admins.
- `staff_credentials` (admin-only readable passwords) and its RLS.
- Extend every RLS policy so an admin has the owner's reach, plus `staff_credentials`.
- S-23: the admin password column, role-aware create form, and the P-07 deactivation guard.
- Seed the admin account (`npm run seed:admin`).

**Done when:**
- pgTAP: an admin reads `staff_credentials` and a receptionist, manager and owner cannot; the last active owner cannot be deactivated.
- E2E: a manager created by the owner logs in with a username; the admin sees stored passwords and creates an owner; an owner cannot deactivate themselves.

## M-03 Catalog and settings (F-21, F-22)
**Read:** 03 §2–3, 03 §12 (categories), 03 §13 (products), 06 S-24–S-27, 07 §3 (related tables), 07 §7.

**Done when:**
- The seed matches BR-010, BR-012, BR-020–022, BR-130 and BR-140 exactly.
- The manager sees S-24 without the fee column; the receptionist cannot open settings.
- pgTAP: a class slot with an unassigned trainer is rejected.
- A plan price change does not alter any existing row.

**Read:** 03 §4, 06 S-28, 08 §7.

**Tasks:**
- `card_batches`, `cards`, `generate_card_batch`.

- S-02 and the header shift badge.
- Receptionist logout confirmation.
- The BR-092 disabled state for money buttons (shared component).

**Done when:**
- E2E: login opens a shift; re-login resumes it; a second receptionist gets S-02 and the takeover works (E19, without the email for now).
- pgTAP: a second open shift is impossible.

**Tasks:**
- `stock_movements`.
- `stock_in`, `stock_sale`, `correct_sale`, `void_stock_movement`.

- S-14.
- Takeover now also sends the report.

**Done when:**
- pgTAP: E15 passes.

- E2E flow 7 passes.
- With a wrong Resend key, the shift still closes and `email_status = 'failed'`.
- The PDF shows č ć š ž đ correctly.

## M-11 Scheduled jobs and backup (F-25, F-26, F-28)
**Read:** 03 §15, 08 §8.

**Tasks:**
- `job_nightly` and `job_expiring_memberships`.
- The `expiry_notifications` table.
- Route handlers, pg_cron schedules, email-retry, expiry email template.
- `backup_runs` table, `backups` bucket, `lib/backup.ts`, the weekly-backup handler, and the S-27 backup status line.

**Done when:**

- A handler call without the secret returns 401.
- The morning job sends exactly one email per qualifying membership and skips renewed and anonymized members.
- With `EMAIL_FROM` unset, reminders are skipped and logged.
- Backup: the US-28.1 acceptance criteria pass. A test ZIP opened with the password contains every table and matching row counts; the wrong password fails.
- Restore test: the CSVs from a backup load into an empty, separate hosted Supabase test project, never the working gym project (D-56; developer steps written down for M-13).

## M-12 Owner finance (F-17, F-18, F-19, F-23, F-24)

- E2E flows 9 and 10 pass.
- Back-dated records do not change any shift summary.

## M-13 Visit statistics, polish and release (F-20, F-27 complete)

**Tasks:**
- `visit_stats` and S-15.
- Empty, loading and error states on every screen, checked against doc 06.

- Full E2E suite.
- Production deployment guide in the README (Supabase push, Vault secrets, Vercel env vars, cron check, Resend domain verification for `stamenkovicc.com`, Resend SMTP in Supabase Auth, and the backup restore steps).

**Done when:**
- All 11 E2E flows pass.
- Every screen was checked at 1366×768 and 375 px (screenshots attached to the report).
- A production deployment was completed with a smoke test (login, scan, close shift).

## Maintenance (after release)
Work found while the gym uses the app. It follows the same steps as a milestone, except that the full E2E suite is never run against the live database: only the specs for what changed, each with its own test gym.

### Dependency security updates (found 26.10.2026)
GitHub Dependabot reported 22 alerts on `main` (3 critical, 6 high); `npm audit` groups them into 7 packages. On 26.10.2026 none was found exploitable in this app, but each has a fix.

| Package | Now | Update to | Exposure in this app |
|---|---|---|---|
| `next` | 16.3.5 | 16.4.3 | The critical one (remote code execution) is in `next/og` `ImageResponse`, which the app does not use; the others are moderate |
| `zod` | 4.6.5 | 4.6.7 | Memory use on oversized collections; no schema uses `z.array`, `z.set` or `z.record` |
| `sharp`, `source-map-js` | transitive | `npm audit fix` | `sharp` only serves the gym logo through `next/image`; `source-map-js` runs at build time only |
| `vitest` (with `@vitest/mocker`, `vite`) | 5.0.1 | 5.0.5 | Development and tests only |

**Tasks:**
- Pin the new exact versions in `package.json` (doc 08 §9) and update `package-lock.json`; `@next/env` and `eslint-config-next` follow `next`.
- Run `npm audit` again.

**When:** after the gym closes. A change to `package.json` starts a new production build on Vercel (D-87).

**Done when:**
- `lint`, `typecheck`, `test` and `test:db` pass.
- The Playwright specs `auth`, `reception` and `finance` pass; each creates and removes its own test gym.
- The Vercel production deployment succeeded, and the owner can sign in and open the finance pages. Nobody signs in as a receptionist, since that opens a shift.
- `npm audit` reports 0 vulnerabilities and Dependabot shows no open alert.
