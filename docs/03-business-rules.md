# 03 — Business Rules

Every rule has an ID. Code comments and tests must reference these IDs, e.g. `// BR-052`.

## 1. Time and money
- **BR-001:** All dates, day boundaries, schedule times and job times use the gym timezone **`Europe/Podgorica`**. "Today" is always `gym_today(gym_id)`, never the server date.
- **BR-002:** Display formats:
  - date `dd.mm.yyyy`;
  - time `HH:mm` (24 h);
  - date-time `dd.mm.yyyy HH:mm`;
  - duration `Xh Ymin`.
- **BR-003:** Money:
  - currency EUR, stored as `numeric(10,2)`, never floats;
  - displayed as `1.234,50 €`;
  - input accepts `,` or `.` as the decimal separator;
  - calculations round to 2 decimals, half-up.
- **BR-004:** Every price is editable by the owner. This covers plan prices, the day pass, the card replacement fee, the personal minimum price, trainer fees, share percentages, and product purchase and sale prices. A price change affects **only new records**; existing records keep their amounts.

## 2. Plans (seed data)
- **BR-010:** The seed creates exactly these plans. The owner can later edit them, add new ones or deactivate them.

| Name (UI) | Kind | Duration | Price | Covers | Limits | Gym fixed amount | Trainer share % | Trainer required |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Nedeljna | gym | 7 days | €39 | gym | — | — | — | no |
| Dvonedeljna | gym | 14 days | €49 | gym | — | — | — | no |
| Mjesečna | gym | 1 month | €79 | gym | — | — | — | no |
| Mjesečna 12 termina | gym | 1 month | €59 | gym | gym 12 | — | — | no |
| Studentska mjesečna | gym | 1 month | €49 | gym | gym 15 | — | — | no |
| Tromjesečna | gym | 3 months | €200 | gym | — | — | — | no |
| Šestomjesečna | gym | 6 months | €400 | gym | — | — | — | no |
| Godišnja | gym | 12 months | €790 | gym | — | — | — | no |
| Grupni (3x nedeljno) | group | 1 month | €69 | group | group 12 | €0 | 70 | yes |
| G+T (Grupni + Teretana) | combo | 1 month | €99 | gym + group | group 12 | €50 | 100 | yes |
| Personalni | personal | 1 month | entered at sale (≥ personal minimum) | personal | personal: entered at sale (1–50) | trainer fee | — | yes |
| Dnevna karta | day_pass | — | €15 per person (D-70) | — | — | — | — | no |

- **BR-011:** "3x nedeljno" in the Grupni name is a label only. There is **no weekly limit**, only the 12-session limit.
- **BR-012:** Other seeded settings:
  - card replacement fee **€5**;
  - personal minimum price **€80** (since D-101 the lowest gym's fixed part of a Personalni sale; the owner wants **€40** for KP Fitness, set on S-27 like any setting);
  - expiry reminder **3 days**;
  - automatic close time **23:00**;
  - double-scan guard **120 s**;
  - shift report recipients **`mihajlo@stamenkovicc.com`**.

> OPEN QUESTION (OQ-2): Should the personal minimum price differ per trainer? It is not decided yet (the trainers set their own prices). **Temporary behaviour:** one gym-wide minimum (default €80), editable by the owner.

## 3. Trainers, programs and schedule
- **BR-020 (seed trainers):**

| Trainer | Personal gym fee | Group share % |
|---|---|---|
| Milena | none | plan default |
| Julija | **unknown** (OQ-1) | plan default |
| Tamara | €80 per client | plan default |
| Tatjana | €80 per client | plan default |

  D-62: a trainer may carry their own group share percentage. Empty means the plan's percentage applies, which is how all four trainers are seeded. Only the owner and the admin see or set it (BR-026).

> OPEN QUESTION (OQ-1): Julija's personal-training arrangement is unknown. **Temporary behaviour:** her fee is empty (`null`). Personal sales with Julija are allowed. Her trainer share and gym share are shown as **"nije definisano"** and are excluded from share totals (but included in revenue).

- **BR-021 (seed programs and assignments):**

| Program | Kind | Trainers assigned |
|---|---|---|
| Grupni trening | group | Milena, Julija, Tamara |
| Personalni trening | personal | Julija, Tamara, Tatjana |

- **BR-022 (seed class slots)**, all in program "Grupni trening":

| Trainer | Days | Start times |
|---|---|---|
| Milena | Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday | 08:00 and 18:00 |
| Julija | Monday, Wednesday, Friday | 08:30 |
| Tamara | Monday, Wednesday, Friday | 19:00 |

- **BR-023:** A trainer is selectable:
  - for a **group** membership or group visit only if they are assigned to at least one active program of kind `group`;
  - for a **personal** membership or personal visit only if they are assigned to at least one active program of kind `personal`.
- **BR-024:** A class slot's trainer must be assigned to that slot's program.
- **BR-025:** Deactivating a trainer, program or class slot:
  - hides it from new selections;
  - does not change existing memberships, visits or reports;
  - removing an assignment has the same effect.
- **BR-026:** Owners and managers manage trainers, programs, assignments and slots. Only the owner sees and edits trainer fees and share percentages.
- **BR-027 (trainer roster, D-72):** S-29 lists, for every staff role, who is assigned to each trainer's fixed class times (BR-058a):
  - A membership is listed when it covers group training, has a trainer, is not voided, its member is not anonymized, and gym today lies between its `start_date` and `end_date`. Used-up sessions do not remove it. A member with two such memberships for the same trainer and time is listed once.
  - Memberships are grouped by trainer, then by fixed class time. Every active class time of every trainer is shown, even with no members. A membership whose time is no longer in the schedule keeps its group, labelled with the clock time alone. Memberships with no fixed class time (sold before D-71) are grouped last under `Termin nije upisan`.
  - Each member shows the membership's plan and the `paid_on` of its payment.
  - **Today:** a class time is held today when its trainer has an active slot at that time on today's weekday, or when someone checked in to such a slot today. For those class times each member shows the time of their first group check-in today to a slot of that trainer at that time, or `—`, and the header says `Došlo danas: <n> / <m>`. Group check-ins today to such a slot by members who are not on that list are shown under `Prijavljeni na čas, a nisu na spisku`, with `neplaćen dolazak` when the visit is unpaid. A group visit with no slot (`Bez časa iz rasporeda`) belongs to no class time.
  - The owner and the admin also see each membership's payment amount as `Cijena po članu (€)`, and per trainer the line `UKUPNO – <trener>` with their sum (BR-003). Nobody else ever receives these amounts (BR-157).
  - There is no limit on the number of members per class time.

## 4. Member cards
- **BR-030 (code):**
  - exactly 10 digits, first digit 1–9;
  - generated randomly and unique across all gyms;
  - the QR code encodes only these 10 digits (digits are safe with any keyboard layout, including QWERTZ).
- **BR-031 (states):**
  - `unassigned` → `active` (assigned to a member) → `deactivated`;
  - no other transitions; a deactivated card is never reactivated.
- **BR-032:** A member has at most one active card.
- **BR-033:** Registering a member **requires** scanning an unassigned card. A member cannot be created without a card.
- **BR-034 (lost card), in one transaction:**
  1. Record a `card_replacement` payment at the current fee, with the chosen method.
  2. Deactivate the old card with reason "izgubljena".
  3. Assign the newly scanned unassigned card.

  It requires an open shift (BR-092). Voiding the fee payment later does not reactivate the old card.
- **BR-035:** A returning former member keeps their member number and active card. If they no longer have the card, BR-034 applies.
- **BR-036 (printing):** owners and admins generate batches of 1–100 unassigned cards and download a print PDF. The layout is in doc 06 (S-28). A manager does not (D-81).

## 5. Members
- **BR-040 (required fields):**

| Field | Rule |
|---|---|
| First name | 1–50 characters, trimmed |
| Last name | 1–50 characters, trimmed |
| Phone | Normalized as in BR-041 |
| Email | Valid format, stored lowercase, maximum 254 characters |
| Date of birth | From 01.01.1900 to gym today |

> ASSUMPTION (AS-2): The allowed date-of-birth range is 01.01.1900 to gym today; there is no minimum age.

- **BR-041 (phone):**
  - Remove spaces, dashes, slashes and parentheses.
  - Leading `00` → `+`.
  - Leading single `0` → `+382` + the rest.
  - The result must match `^\+[0-9]{8,15}$`.
  - Example: `067 123 456` → `+38267123456`.

> ASSUMPTION (AS-1): Numbers without a country code are Montenegrin (+382).

- **BR-042 (member number):** assigned at creation as the gym's next sequential number, starting at **1**; never reused.
- **BR-043 (duplicates):** if another non-anonymized member has the same normalized phone or the same email, show a warning. The warning offers "Otvori postojećeg" (open the existing member) and "Ipak sačuvaj" (save anyway). The save is not blocked.

> ASSUMPTION (AS-3): Duplicates only produce a warning, never a block.

- **BR-044 (search):** matches member number (exact), first or last name (partial, case- and diacritic-insensitive, e.g. "cosic" finds "Ćosić"), and phone digits (partial). Anonymized members are excluded.
- **BR-045:** Staff of every role can edit a member's first name, last name, phone, email and date of birth. Every edit is written to the audit log.
- **BR-046 (anonymization, owner only, irreversible):**
  - first name becomes `Anonimizirani`;
  - last name becomes `član #<member_number>`;
  - phone, email and date of birth are set to `null`;
  - the active card is deactivated with reason "anonimizirano";
  - `is_anonymized = true`;
  - memberships, payments and visits are kept;
  - the member is excluded from search and from emails.

## 6. Memberships
- **BR-050 (coverage):**

| Plan kind | Visit types covered |
|---|---|
| `gym` | gym |
| `group` | group |
| `combo` (G+T) | gym and group |
| `personal` | personal |

  Coverage, limits, trainer, gym fixed amount, share percentage and trainer fee are **copied onto the membership at sale**. Later plan or trainer edits never change existing memberships.

  The share percentage copied for a `group` or `combo` sale is the **trainer's own group share if they have one, otherwise the plan's** (D-62). `resolve_group_share(trainer, plan)` answers that question in one place, so the rule cannot drift between the sale and the reports.
- **BR-051 (last valid day, inclusive):**
  - Month plans: `end_date = start_date + N calendar months` (Postgres interval arithmetic).
    - 12.01 → 12.02.
    - 31.01.2027 → 28.02.2027.
  - Day plans: `end_date = start_date + N days`. Nedeljna 13.09 → 20.09.
  - The membership can be used on every date from `start_date` to `end_date`, both included.
- **BR-052 (start date).** Let D = sale date (gym today; for back-dated sales, the owner's chosen date). "Comparable memberships" are the member's non-voided memberships whose coverage shares at least one visit type with the new plan. Let L = the latest `end_date` among them (none if there are no comparable memberships).
  1. **If L ≥ D:** start = L + 1 day. Reason: `Nastavlja se na članarinu koja važi do <L>`.
  2. **Otherwise**, take the member's unlinked unpaid visits whose visit type is covered by the new plan and whose local date is after L (or any date, if there is no L) and ≤ D.
     - If there are any, let V = the earliest visit date and compute E = end date for start V.
     - **If E ≥ D:** start = V, and all those visits dated ≤ E are linked to the new membership and use up its sessions. Reason: `Počinje od prvog neplaćenog dolaska <V>`.
     - **If E < D:** the visits stay unlinked, and processing continues with step 3. The screen warns: `Neplaćeni dolasci su stariji od trajanja ove članarine i ostaju neplaćeni.`
  3. **Otherwise:** start = D. Reason: `Počinje danas`.
  4. **Start override (D-97):** any staff role (owner, manager, receptionist) can override the computed start date at sale with any date, earlier or later. The last valid day follows from the chosen start (BR-051), and the member's unlinked unpaid visits of covered types dated from the chosen start up to today are linked to the new membership. The reason names the role: `Početak je odredio vlasnik.` (owner and admin), `Početak je odredio menadžer.` or `Početak je odredio recepcioner.`. A back-dated sale by the owner uses the owner's chosen date, and steps 1–3 are shown as a suggestion only.

> ASSUMPTION (AS-8): When there is no comparable membership, all unlinked unpaid visits of covered types qualify.

> ASSUMPTION (AS-9): The "E < D" fallback in step 2.

- **BR-053 (covers a visit):** membership M covers visit type T on date X when all of the following hold:
  - M is not voided;
  - `start_date ≤ X ≤ end_date`;
  - T is in M's coverage;
  - M has no limit for T, or the visits of type T already linked to M are fewer than the limit.
- **BR-054 (display status on date X, default gym today):**

| Status | UI label | Condition |
|---|---|---|
| `voided` | Poništena | M is voided |
| `upcoming` | Buduća | X < start |
| `expired` | Istekla | X > end |
| `active` | Aktivna | M covers at least one type on X |
| `used_up` | Iskorištena | In the date range, but every covered type has reached its limit |

  A G+T membership whose group sessions are used up is still `active` (the gym part is unlimited). The UI shows `Grupni: 0 preostalo`.
- **BR-055 (remaining sessions):** limit − number of visits of that type linked to the membership. **Every visit counts**, including a second visit on the same day. Check-out never uses a session. Unused sessions expire at `end_date` and are never transferred.
- **BR-056 (pause, D-100):** a membership may be paused, **7 days at most in total**; nothing else extends it, and only a new sale adds time.
  - Any staff role pauses it on S-07: from a day that is today or later and not after its last valid day, for 1 day up to what is left of the 7. Pauses of one membership never overlap. A pause cannot begin today when the member already came in today on that membership (`E_PAUSE_VISITED`).
  - Every paused day moves the last valid day one day later. A non-voided membership of the same member that shares a visit type and starts the day after the old last day (BR-052 step 1) moves by as many days, with its own pauses, and so on down the chain.
  - On a paused day the membership covers nothing (BR-053) and its status is `paused`, `Pauzirana` (BR-054).
  - A member who comes in on a paused day ends that pause: the check-in (scan or manual start) gives back the days from today, and the last valid day keeps only the days already paused. [Prekini pauzu] does the same by hand; a pause that has not begun is given back whole.
  - Errors: `E_PAUSE_INVALID`, `E_PAUSE_TOO_LONG`, `E_PAUSE_OVERLAP`, `E_PAUSE_VISITED`. Pauses are audited (BR-096) and never deleted.
- **BR-057:** A member may hold any number of memberships at once (e.g. Mjesečna + Personalni). Selling a new membership before the current one ends is allowed; it becomes `upcoming` (BR-052 step 1).

  This is also how a mid-term change of plan is handled (D-61). A member who paid for Grupni and wants Personalni two weeks later simply buys Personalni; because the two plans share no visit type they are not comparable, so the new membership starts today (BR-052 step 3) while the old one runs to its own end date and its unused sessions expire (BR-055). Nothing is prorated, refunded or transferred, and the old membership is not voided.
- **BR-058 (trainer):**
  - Grupni, G+T and Personalni require a trainer who meets BR-023.
  - ~~The trainer's current fee is copied onto a Personalni membership at sale.~~ Since D-101 a Personalni sale carries the gym's fixed part typed at sale instead (BR-059); the trainer's fee from S-24 is no longer copied.
  - The trainer suggested by default is the trainer of the member's latest membership of the same plan kind.
- **BR-058a (fixed class time, D-71):**
  - A plan that covers group training and requires a trainer (seed: Grupni, G+T) also requires the member's **fixed class time** (`Fiksni termin`), chosen after the trainer, in S-05, S-08 and S-22.
  - The choices are only the chosen trainer's active group class times: one entry per start time, listing every weekday on which that trainer has an active class slot at that time in an active program of kind `group` (e.g. `Uto, čet, sub · 08:00`). Inactive slots and programs are not offered (BR-025).
  - A trainer with no active class time cannot be sold for such a plan. The form says `Trener nema nijedan aktivan termin u rasporedu, pa se članarina ne može prodati.` and the database refuses the sale.
  - The time is stored on the membership beside its trainer. The time suggested by default is the time of the member's latest membership with the chosen trainer, if it is still active.
  - Any staff role may change the fixed class time of a group membership that is neither voided nor expired, to another active time of **the same trainer**, from S-07 ([Promijeni termin]). The trainer, amount and payment do not change, no new sale is made, and the change is audited (BR-096).
  - Memberships sold before D-71 have no fixed class time until one is set this way. What the stored time is used for beyond S-07 is not decided yet.
- **BR-059 (amount):**
  - For plans with a list price, the amount equals the list price; only the owner can change it (at sale, or later via BR-094).
  - **Personalni (D-101):** there is no separate amount. Any staff role enters the **gym's fixed part** (`Fiksni dio za teretanu (€)`), which is required and **is the amount**: the member pays it at the desk (BR-060) and all of it goes to the gym. It must be ≥ the personal minimum price (BR-012), otherwise: `Fiksni dio za teretanu ne može biti manji od <min> €.` It is stored with the membership's financial terms (BR-050) and used by BR-155.
  - The personal session count is entered at sale: whole number 1–50.
  - ~~Gym's fixed part (D-99): from 0 to a separately typed amount; left empty, the trainer's fee applies.~~ Superseded by D-101 on 02.10.2026.
- **BR-060:** Every membership sale creates **exactly one** payment for the full amount in the same transaction. There are no partial payments and no debts.

## 7. Visits (check-in and check-out)
- **BR-070 (scan decision).** The scanner sends characters followed by Enter. The input is trimmed and handled as follows:

| Input | Result |
|---|---|
| Not exactly 10 digits | Message `Neispravan kod kartice.` Nothing is recorded. |
| Unknown code | `Nepoznata kartica.` |
| Deactivated card | `Kartica je poništena. Pronađite člana pretragom.` |
| Unassigned card | Opens registration (S-05) with this card attached. |
| Active card, member has an open visit | Check-out (BR-072). |
| Active card, no open visit, the member's last visit was checked out automatically at most 60 minutes ago | Leaving after an automatic check-out (BR-072a). |
| Active card, no open visit | Check-in flow (BR-073 onward). |

- **BR-071:** A member has at most one open visit.
- **BR-072 (check-out):**
  - Set the check-out time to now and show `Odjavljen/a: <Ime Prezime> – <trajanje>`.
  - **Double-scan guard:** if the open visit started less than the configured number of seconds ago (default 120), ask first: `<Ime Prezime> je prijavljen/a prije <N> s. Odjaviti?` [Odjavi] [Ne].
- **BR-072a (leaving after an automatic check-out, D-74):**
  - Applies when the member has no open visit, their latest visit was checked out automatically (BR-082a or BR-082), and that check-out was at most 60 minutes ago.
  - A scan of the card then does not start a check-in. The automatic check-out is replaced by a real one: `checked_out_at` = now, `checked_out_by` = the staff member, `auto_checkout = false`. The result is the same as BR-072: `Odjavljen/a: <Ime Prezime> – <trajanje>`, with the duration from the check-in.
  - [Odjavi] in "U teretani" (BR-080) on a row the list still shows after the job closed it does the same.
  - A scan more than 60 minutes after the automatic check-out is a new check-in (BR-073 onward). The 60 minutes are fixed.
- **BR-073 (visit type, D-102):**
  - The options are **Teretana** plus every other type (Grupni, Personalni) covered by any of the member's memberships in the date range today, even if that type's sessions are used up.
  - **The question (S-03a) is asked only when the member's memberships in the date range today cover two or more visit types:** G+T, or Teretana together with Grupni or Personalni as separate memberships (or Grupni with Personalni). Otherwise the visit is recorded at once, with no question:
    - **Teretana only, or nothing valid:** a gym visit with the BR-074 default membership, also when several gym memberships cover today; unpaid when none does (BR-078).
    - **Grupni only:** the visit belongs to the group membership that covers today (earliest `end_date` first, BR-074), or, when every session is used up, to the one in its date range. When the member is **at their class**, it is a group visit with that membership's trainer and that class. Their class is the membership's fixed class time (BR-058a), when its trainer has an active slot at that time today starting within ±90 minutes of now (AS-12). A membership with no fixed class time (sold before D-71) takes the trainer's BR-075 default slot. Used-up sessions make it an unpaid group visit (BR-079). **Outside their class it is an unpaid gym visit:** a Grupni-only member may not use the gym at other times.
    - **Personalni only:** a personal visit with that membership's trainer (chosen as for Grupni), unpaid when its sessions are used up.
    - If that membership's trainer no longer meets BR-023 for the visit type, S-03a is shown so the receptionist picks one (BR-075, BR-076).
  - "Prijavi odmah" at registration (US-06.1 AC2) records the visit by the same rule. A new G+T member, who would be asked, takes the preselection below (Teretana).
  - On S-03a, preselect Teretana if a membership covers gym today; else preselect Grupni; else Personalni. Enter confirms the preselection.
- **BR-074 (which membership).**
  - Candidates are memberships that cover the chosen type today (BR-053).
  - If there are candidates, preselect the one with the earliest `end_date` (ties: earliest created). On S-03a the receptionist may pick another candidate. The visit is linked to it and uses a session if a limit applies.
  - If there are none, the visit is **unpaid** (`is_unpaid = true`, no membership).
- **BR-075 (group visit):**
  - A trainer is required, chosen from BR-023 group trainers.
  - Default trainer: the selected membership's trainer; if unpaid, the trainer of the member's latest group or combo membership; otherwise no default.
  - Default class slot: the active slot of the chosen trainer on today's weekday whose start time is closest to now and within ±90 minutes; otherwise "Bez časa iz rasporeda".
  - The receptionist may pick any of that trainer's slots for today, or "Bez časa iz rasporeda".

> ASSUMPTION (AS-12): The ±90-minute window.

- **BR-076 (personal visit):** a trainer is required, chosen from BR-023 personal trainers. The default is the selected membership's trainer. No class slot.
- **BR-077 (gym visit):** no trainer, no class slot.
- **BR-078 (entry is never blocked):** a visit is always recorded, paid or unpaid. This includes a Grupni-only member scanned outside their class (BR-073), and Teretana chosen on S-03a for a member without gym coverage: both become an unpaid gym visit.
- **BR-079 (result on screen):**
  - **Covered visit:** a green dialog showing:
    - name and member number;
    - the covering membership's plan;
    - `Važi do` (valid until);
    - remaining sessions for the visit type (or `Neograničeno`);
    - status.

    A short "ok" sound plays. The dialog closes after 5 s, on Esc, or when the next scan arrives (the next scan is then processed).
  - **Unpaid visit:** let N = the member's number of unlinked unpaid visits, including this one.
    - **N = 1:** yellow dialog `Članarina nije važeća – neplaćeni dolazak.` with the "warning" sound.
    - **N ≥ 2:** full-screen red dialog `PAŽNJA: <N>. neplaćeni dolazak!` with the "alarm" sound.
    - Both dialogs have [Produži članarinu] (opens S-08) and [Zatvori]. Neither closes automatically.

> ASSUMPTION (AS-13): The 5-second auto-close of the green dialog.

- **BR-080 (manual):**
  - Manual check-in: search a member (BR-044), then follow the same flow with `is_manual = true`.
  - Manual check-out: the [Odjavi] button in the "U teretani" list.
- **BR-081:** "U teretani" is the list of open visits. Day-pass and FitPass visitors are never recorded.
- **BR-082 (automatic check-out):**
  - At the automatic close time (default 23:00), every open visit gets `checked_out_at` = that time today and `auto_checkout = true`.
  - Automatic check-outs are excluded from visit-duration statistics.
- **BR-082a (automatic check-out after 1 h 30 min, D-74):**
  - Every open visit that began 1 h 30 min ago or earlier gets `checked_out_at` = check-in + 1 h 30 min and `auto_checkout = true`, and leaves "U teretani". The time is exact, whenever the job notices it.
  - A database job does this every 5 minutes (BR-162, D-84), so a member can still be listed in "U teretani" for up to 5 minutes after the 1 h 30 min. The 1 h 30 min is fixed, for every visit type.
  - As with BR-082, these check-outs are excluded from visit-duration statistics, unless BR-072a turns one into a real check-out.
- **BR-083 (back-dated visit, owner only):**
  - The owner enters member, date, check-in time, check-out time (> check-in), visit type, and trainer/slot when needed.
  - The membership is chosen per BR-074 as of that date.
  - `is_backdated = true`; the visit has no shift.

## 8. Payments, corrections and voids
- **BR-090:** Payment methods are cash (`Gotovina`) and card (`Platna kartica`) only.
- **BR-091:** Payment kinds are `membership`, `day_pass` and `card_replacement`. Bar sales are stock movements, and they count as income too.
- **BR-092 (shift required):**
  - Every money record that is not back-dated must be attached to the gym's open shift, whoever enters it (receptionist, manager or owner). Money records are payments, sales, and paid-from-till expenses, including stock-in paid from the till.
  - If no shift is open, these actions are disabled with: `Nema otvorene smjene. Recepcioner mora biti prijavljen.`
- **BR-093:** `paid_on` = gym today. Only the owner can enter another date, through a back-dated entry (BR-120).
- **BR-094 (correction):**
  - Any role may change the **method** and **note** of a payment or sale **attached to the currently open shift**.
  - Only the owner may change the **amount**, and only the owner may correct records from closed shifts or back-dated records.

> ASSUMPTION (AS-14): Non-owners may correct and void only records of the currently open shift, so closed shift reports never change behind the owner's back.

- **BR-095 (void):**
  - Permissions are the same as BR-094.
  - A reason of 3–200 characters is required.
  - Voided records are excluded from every total. They are listed separately and struck through.
  - Voiding a **membership** payment also voids the membership. Its linked visits become unlinked unpaid visits (`membership_id = null`, `is_unpaid = true`).
  - Voiding a **sale** returns the quantity to stock.
  - Voiding a **stock-in** (owner only) also voids its automatic expense. It is blocked if it would make stock negative: `Poništavanje nije moguće – stanje bi bilo negativno.`
  - Voiding a **stock adjustment** (owner and admin only, D-103) puts the stock back where it was: goods short return, goods found are taken away, which is blocked with the same message if it would make stock negative.

> ASSUMPTION (AS-15): Sales and stock-ins can be voided under these rules.

- **BR-096:** Every correction, void, price change, settings change and member edit writes an audit-log row with the old and new values, who made it and when.

## 9. Day passes
- **BR-100:** Day pass sale:
  - quantity 1–20;
  - unit price = the current day-pass plan price (not editable at sale);
  - amount = quantity × price;
  - method required;
  - no member, no visit;
  - requires an open shift.

## 10. Shifts
- **BR-110:** Only the **receptionist** role has shifts. At most **one open shift per gym**.
- **BR-111 (receptionist login):**
  - **No open shift:** a new shift is opened automatically.
  - **Open shift is theirs:** it is resumed.
  - **Open shift belongs to someone else:** show S-02 with `Otvorena je smjena: <ime> (od <HH:mm>).` and two options:
    - [Preuzmi smjenu]: an optional "Prebrojana gotovina za prethodnu smjenu" field, then the other shift is closed with `close_type = 'takeover'` and `closed_by` = the current user, its report is generated and emailed (BR-117), and a new shift is opened;
    - [Odjavi se].

> ASSUMPTION (AS-10): The counted cash at takeover is optional.

- **BR-112:** An owner or manager login never opens or closes shifts by itself. Their money actions attach to the open shift (BR-092).
- **BR-113 (logout without closing):** a receptionist may log out without closing, after confirming `Smjena ostaje otvorena. Odjaviti se?`. The shift stays open and can be resumed or taken over.

> ASSUMPTION (AS-16): Logging out without closing the shift is allowed.

- **BR-114 (close shift):** the shift's receptionist closes it on S-14:
  1. Review the summary.
  2. Enter the counted cash (required, ≥ 0).
  3. Confirm. The shift is closed with `close_type = 'manual'`.
  4. The report PDF is generated and stored, and the email is sent (BR-117).
  5. The user is logged out.

  The owner may also close any open shift from S-19 (counted cash optional).
- **BR-115 (expected cash and totals):** over non-voided records attached to the shift:
  - `cash_income` = cash payments + cash sales;
  - `card_income` = card payments + card sales;
  - `till_expenses` = expenses with `paid_from_till = true`;
  - `expected_cash` = `cash_income − till_expenses`;
  - `difference` = `counted_cash − expected_cash`. Negative is shown as "Manjak", positive as "Višak". Not shown when the cash was not counted.
  - Managers may read the currently open shift's `cash_income`, `card_income`, `till_expenses` and `expected_cash` (D-54). This grants aggregate totals only; expense details still follow BR-134, and closed-shift reports remain owner-only. D-80 lets a manager list the shifts of today, this week or this month on S-19, with their totals but without the report PDF or its email status.
- **BR-116 (automatic close):**
  - At the automatic close time (default 23:00), after BR-082, the open shift is closed with `close_type = 'auto'` and no counted cash.
  - The report states: `Automatski zaključeno u 23:00 – gotovina nije prebrojana.`
  - The receptionist's next request redirects to the login page.
- **BR-117 (shift report).** The PDF contains:
  - **Header:**
    - gym name;
    - receptionist;
    - start and end date-time;
    - close type (Zaključio/la <ime>, Preuzeo/la <ime>, Automatski). For a manual close the name is `closed_by`: the receptionist on S-14 or the owner on S-19 (D-64);
    - generated-at time.
  - **Payments table:** time, member (number and name) or "—", kind, plan, method, amount, entered by.
  - **Day passes:** quantity and total per method.
  - **Card replacements:** count and total.
  - **Bar sales:** product, quantity, method, amount.
  - **Till expenses:** time, category, description, amount, entered by.
  - **Totals:** cash income, card income, till expenses, expected cash, counted cash, difference.
  - **Voided records:** listed with their reasons.
  - **Open visits** at close time: count.

  Email:
  - recipients: gym setting `shift_report_emails`, plus every active owner who has an email (D-65);
  - subject: `Izvještaj smjene – <ime> – <dd.mm.yyyy> <HH:mm>–<HH:mm>`;
  - short text body, with the PDF attached.
- **BR-118 (email failure):**
  - The shift stays closed and `email_status = 'failed'`.
  - The system retries every 15 minutes, up to 5 attempts in total.
  - The owner sees the status on S-19 and can press [Pošalji ponovo]. A manager sees neither (D-80).
- **BR-119:** No idle timeout. Sessions end only on logout, shift close, or an automatic close (receptionists).

## 11. Back-dated entries
- **BR-120:** Only the owner can create back-dated entries (S-22), used after an internet outage:
  - visits (BR-083);
  - membership sales (with start date and payment date);
  - day passes;
  - card replacement payments.

  They have `is_backdated = true` and no shift. They:
  - are excluded from shift reports and expected cash;
  - are included in finance and statistics;
  - are recorded in the audit log.

## 12. Expenses
- **BR-130 (seed categories):** Kirija, Plate (`is_salary`), Komunalije, Struja, Voda, Internet/telefon, Održavanje, Potrošni materijal, Marketing, Oprema, Roba za prodaju (`is_system`), Porezi i doprinosi, Bankarske naknade, Ostalo.
- **BR-131 (owner manages categories):**
  - add (name 2–50 characters, unique);
  - rename;
  - deactivate or reactivate;
  - categories are never deleted;
  - `is_system` categories cannot be deactivated;
  - deactivated categories are hidden from new expenses but stay on old ones.
- **BR-132 (desk expense, any role, D-98):** [Trošak] on S-03 is the BR-133 form, for every role.
  - category: active, and not "Roba za prodaju" (goods come in only through Nova roba, BR-141; D-92); salary categories, and so payouts, only for the owner and the admin (D-37, D-80);
  - "Iz kase" is ticked when the dialog opens while a shift is open;
  - a manager's or receptionist's expense needs an open shift and is attached to it, whatever its date, so they can void it while it is open (BR-135); only what is paid from the till counts in the shift's cash (BR-115).
- **BR-133 (expense form; S-17 and, since D-98, the desk):**

| Field | Rule |
|---|---|
| Date (`Datum plaćanja`) | The day it was paid, ≤ gym today |
| Trošak za mjesec (D-104) | The month the expense is for: the month of the date (the default) or one of the 12 months before it, for every role. The month of the date is stored as none. Never for goods bought (BR-141). |
| Category | Any active category except "Roba za prodaju" (D-92) |
| Description | 2–200 characters |
| Amount | 0.01–100,000.00 |
| Method | Cash / Platna kartica / Van kase |
| Paid from till | Checkbox. If ticked: date forced to today, method cash, open shift required. |
| Supplier | Optional, ≤ 100 characters |
| Invoice number | Optional, ≤ 50 characters |
| VAT included | Optional: Da / Ne / not set |
| Trainer | Only for a salary category, optional. Marks the expense as a payout to that trainer. |

- **BR-134:** Receptionists see only the expenses **they** created **today**. The owner sees all. A manager sees every expense **except salary categories**, read-only: on S-17 for today, this week or this month (D-80), and on S-12 for today (D-96); a manager's direct read of the table is still only their own of today.
- **BR-135:** An expense void requires a reason. The owner can void any expense; others only their own records of the open shift (AS-14).
- **BR-136 (fixed expenses, owner only, D-93):** the owner describes a cost that repeats every month — rent, internet, a staff salary — once, on S-30, and it is posted as an expense on the 1st of every month.
  - **Fields:**
    - `Naziv` (the expense's description), 2–200 characters;
    - `Kategorija`: active, and not "Roba za prodaju" (goods come in through Nova roba, D-92); a salary category is allowed;
    - `Iznos`: 0.01–100,000.00;
    - `Način`: Gotovina, Platna kartica or Van kase (`null`, AS-17); never from the till;
    - `Od mjeseca`: this month or a later one;
    - `Aktivan`.
  - **Posting:** for every active fixed expense whose first month has begun, one expense for the gym's month (BR-001):
    - `spent_on` = the 1st of the month;
    - description, category, amount and method from the fixed expense;
    - `paid_from_till = false`, no shift;
    - `created_by` = the owner who added the fixed expense.

    It is posted by the daily job at 00:05 on the 1st (BR-162), or at once when a fixed expense is added or reactivated during a month that has begun.
  - **At most once a month:** a posted month is never posted again, not even after the owner voided it. A month the owner does not want, or wants at another amount, is voided on S-17 and, if needed, entered by hand.
  - **Changes** (name, category, amount, method, active) apply from the next posting; posted expenses keep their values (as BR-004). `Od mjeseca` can change only while nothing has been posted, and never to a past month, so nothing is ever posted for the past.
  - **Nothing is deleted:** deactivating stops the posting; posted expenses stay.
  - A fixed salary is not linked to a trainer. Trainer payouts stay on S-18 (BR-156).
  - Posted expenses are ordinary expenses: operating expenses in the statement and Ostala plaćanja in the cash flow (BR-151, BR-158), listed on S-17 with the badge `Fiksni`, and hidden from a manager when their category is a salary category (D-80).

## 13. Magacin (bar storage)
- **BR-140 (products):**
  - managed by the owner, the admin and the manager, on S-13 Magacin (D-76); never by a receptionist;
  - name 2–50 characters, unique;
  - sale price > 0;
  - current purchase price ≥ 0;
  - active flag.
  - Seed: **Voda**, purchase €0.30, sale €1.50.
- **BR-141 (stock-in, any role).** Inputs (D-95: the owner's expense form of BR-133 without the category, plus the quantity and the price):
  - product (active), chosen by clicking [Nova roba] in its row;
  - quantity 1–10,000;
  - purchase price per unit (prefilled with the current price, editable, ≥ €0.01, "as written on the invoice"); free deliveries are not allowed (D-55); `Ukupno` = quantity × price is shown;
  - description: prefilled `Nabavka: <proizvod> × <količina>` and following the quantity until edited; 2–200 characters; left empty, that text is written;
  - date: the day the goods were **paid**, ≤ gym today; only the owner and the admin may choose an earlier day, for every other role it is today;
  - method: Gotovina, Platna kartica or Van kase (`null`, AS-17);
  - Iz kase: checkbox; if ticked, the date is today, the method cash, and an open shift is required;
  - supplier ≤ 100 characters, invoice number ≤ 50 characters, VAT included Da / Ne / not set, all optional.

  In one transaction:
  1. Stock increases **now**, whatever the date (the date dates the payment only).
  2. The product's current purchase price becomes the entered price.
  3. An expense is created automatically:
     - category "Roba za prodaju";
     - the description, date, method, Iz kase, supplier, invoice number and VAT above;
     - amount = quantity × price;
     - attached to the open shift when its date is today, to no shift for an earlier day.

  "Iz kase" requires an open shift.

> ASSUMPTION (AS-6): The entered purchase price becomes the product's current purchase price and is used as the cost of later sales.

> ASSUMPTION (AS-17): "Van kase" is stored as `method = null`.

- **BR-142 (sale, any role):**
  - product (active), quantity ≥ 1, method required;
  - unit price = the product's sale price (not editable at sale);
  - unit cost = the current purchase price (snapshot);
  - blocked if quantity > stock: `Nema dovoljno na stanju (stanje: <X>).`;
  - requires an open shift.
- **BR-143:** Stock level = Σ stock-in − Σ sales + Σ adjustments (non-voided; an adjustment carries its own sign, D-103). There is no opening stock; the first stock-in creates it.
- **BR-144:** Managers and receptionists see product, stock level, purchase price and sale price. They never see stock value, profit, Manjak robe (BR-145), or totals over more than today.
- **BR-145 (stock adjustment, Poravnanje stanja, D-103):** when the goods on the shelf and the stock level disagree, the owner, the admin or the manager enters on S-13 what was counted (P-45); never a receptionist.
  - **Inputs:** the product (active), chosen by [Poravnaj stanje] in its row; `Prebrojano stanje` 0–10,000; `Razlog`; `Napomena`, at most 200 characters, required (3–200) for Ostalo.
  - **Reasons:** for goods short (`manjak`) Oštećeno, Istekao rok, Potrošeno u teretani, Manjak pri popisu or Ostalo; for goods found (`višak`) only Višak pri popisu or Ostalo, and the dialog reminds: `Ako je stigla nova roba, unesite je preko „Nova roba“ – tako se evidentira i trošak nabavke.`
  - **Recording:** the difference, counted − stock level, is written as a stock movement of type `adjust` with its sign, the count, the reason, the note and the product's current purchase price as its unit cost (AS-6). A count equal to the stock level writes nothing. The stock changes at once.
  - **A count that no longer matches:** the stock level the dialog showed goes with the count. If a sale or a stock-in changed it meanwhile, nothing is written: `Stanje se u međuvremenu promijenilo (sada: <X>). Prebrojte ponovo.` (E_STOCK_CHANGED), and the dialog shows the stock level now.
  - **Not money:** an adjustment has no expense, no payment and no shift, and changes neither expected cash (BR-115) nor the cash flow (BR-158); the goods were paid for at Nova roba.
  - **Manjak robe** (owner only) for a period = Σ over non-voided adjustments, by local date, of −difference × unit cost: goods short are a cost, goods found lower it. It is a line of the income statement under the cost of goods sold, and lowers gross profit and profit (BR-152), the Troškovi card and the chart. Bar profit stays BR-153's margin on sales. The stock value follows the stock level (BR-159).
  - **Voiding** follows BR-095 (owner and admin). When the same product was counted again after the adjustment, the void dialog warns: `Ovaj proizvod je poslije ovog poravnanja ponovo prebrojan. Ako ga poništite, stanje se više neće slagati sa posljednjim brojanjem.` Adjustments are audited (BR-096).

## 14. Finance calculations (owner only, except D-80)
Buying goods and the cost of the goods sold are two different things (D-92). A stock-in moves money and stock; only a sale turns the purchase price of what was sold into a cost.

- **BR-150:** Income for a period = non-voided payments by `paid_on` + non-voided sales by local date. The owner's statement groups it (D-92):
  - **Članarine:** payments of gym plans (`kind = 'gym'`) and day passes;
  - **Treninzi (grupni i personalni):** payments of group, G+T and personal plans;
  - **Prodaja iz magacina:** the sales;
  - **Ostalo:** card replacements.
- **BR-151:** Expenses for a period, non-voided, are of two kinds (D-92). In the income statement an operating expense counts on the day it was paid, or, when it is for another month (`Trošak za mjesec`, D-104), on the 1st of that month; goods bought count on the day paid:
  - **Nabavka robe (goods bought):** the automatic stock-in expenses (`stock_movement_id` set). They are money paid (BR-158) and stock (BR-159), never a cost in the profit.
  - **Operativni troškovi (operating expenses):** every other expense, trainer payouts and salaries included.

  A manager's expenses (D-80, BR-157) stay what was paid in the period, by `spent_on`, and so do S-17's list and the shift (BR-115).
- **BR-152:** Profit = income − cost of goods sold (BR-153) − Manjak robe (BR-145, D-103) − operating expenses (BR-151). Bruto dobit (gross profit) = income − cost of goods sold − Manjak robe.
- **BR-153:** Cost of goods sold (`Trošak prodate robe`) = Σ over non-voided sales of quantity × unit cost, by the sale's local date. The unit cost is the purchase price at the moment of the sale (BR-142, AS-6). Bar profit (`Zarada na magacinu`, shown separately) = Σ sales quantity × (unit price − unit cost).
- **BR-154 (trainer revenue):** a membership payment belongs to the **membership's** trainer and to the month of `paid_on`. A group visit with another trainer changes only that other trainer's session count.
- **BR-155 (shares per membership payment):**
  - **Grupni and G+T:** trainer share = max(amount − gym fixed amount, 0) × share % / 100, where the share % is the one stored on the membership at sale (BR-050, D-62) — never the plan's current value.
  - **Personalni:**
    - the trainer fee is the gym's fixed part stored at sale (D-99). Since D-101 it equals the amount, so a new sale gives the trainer 0 and the gym the whole amount; a sale from before D-101 keeps the fixed part or trainer's fee it was sold with;
    - trainer fee `null` → trainer share and gym share are "nije definisano";
    - otherwise trainer share = amount − trainer fee;
    - if the result is negative → 0, with the warning `Iznos manji od naknade teretani`.
  - **Gym share** = amount − trainer share.

> ASSUMPTION (AS-7): A negative trainer share becomes 0 with a warning.

- **BR-156 (trainer statistics for a month, per trainer):**

| Metric | Definition |
|---|---|
| Klijenti | Distinct members with a non-voided membership payment attributed to the trainer in that month |
| Održani grupni treninzi | Distinct (local date, class slot) pairs among group visits with that trainer. Visits without a slot count as one pair per date. |
| Personalni treninzi | Number of personal visits with that trainer |
| Prihod | Sum of attributed payments |
| Za trenera (za isplatu) | Sum of defined trainer shares |
| Za teretanu | Sum of defined gym shares |
| Isplaćeno | Sum of non-voided salary-category expenses with this trainer for that month: paid in it, or paid later for it (`Trošak za mjesec`, D-104) |
| Razlika | Za isplatu − Isplaćeno |

- **BR-157:** No value from §14 is ever returned to managers or receptionists, with one exception (D-80): a manager receives BR-150 income and BR-151 expenses **without salary categories**, for today, this week or this month only. A manager's expenses are what was paid, stock-ins included, exactly as S-17 lists them. BR-145 Manjak robe, BR-152 profit, BR-153 cost of goods sold and bar profit, BR-154 to BR-156, BR-158 and BR-159 never reach a manager.
- **BR-158 (cash flow, D-92):** for a period, by the day each expense was paid (`spent_on`), whatever month it is for (D-104):
  - **Primljeno** = income (BR-150), cash and card;
  - **Plaćena nova roba** = the non-voided stock-in expenses by `spent_on`, sold or not;
  - **Ostala plaćanja** = all other non-voided expenses by `spent_on`;
  - **Neto promjena novca** = Primljeno − Plaćena nova roba − Ostala plaćanja.
  - A stock adjustment moves no money and is in none of these (BR-145).
- **BR-159 (stock value at a date, D-92):** Σ over products of the stock level at the end of the day (adjustments included, BR-143) × the purchase price in effect then. For a period that reaches today, that is today's stock at the current purchase price (as on S-13). For an earlier end, the price is the unit cost of the last non-voided stock-in before the end of that day, or the current purchase price if there was none. Because the cost of a sale is the purchase price of the moment (AS-6), stock value equals "goods bought − cost of goods sold" only while the purchase price stays the same.

## 15. Notifications and jobs
- **BR-160 (expiry reminder email):**
  - **When:** daily at 09:00 gym time.
  - **Who:** for each non-voided membership whose `end_date = gym today + expiry_reminder_days` (default 3).
  - **Only if all of these hold:**
    - the member is not anonymized;
    - the member has no comparable membership starting after it;
    - no reminder was sent for that membership before.
  - Date-based only; nothing is sent when sessions run out.
  - Content is in doc 08 §7.

- **BR-161 (sender address):** all emails are sent from **`noreply@stamenkovicc.com`** (D-F8). The address comes from the environment variable `EMAIL_FROM`, so it can later be switched to the gym's own domain without code changes. The domain `stamenkovicc.com` must be verified in Resend before go-live. If `EMAIL_FROM` is not set (local development), all emails are skipped and logged; a skipped shift report keeps `email_status = 'not_sent'`.

- **BR-162 (jobs):**

| Job | Schedule (gym time) | Steps |
|---|---|---|
| Nightly | Daily at the automatic close time (default 23:00) | 1. BR-082 automatic check-out. 2. BR-116 automatic shift close. 3. Report and email (BR-117). |
| Auto check-out | Every 5 minutes | BR-082a (D-74, D-84) |
| Morning | Daily at 09:00 | BR-160 reminders |
| Retry | Every 15 minutes | BR-118 failed shift emails |
| Weekly backup | Every Sunday at 03:00 | BR-163 |
| Cron log cleanup | Daily at 03:17 UTC | Delete pg_cron run records older than 7 days (D-88) |
| Fixed expenses | Daily at 00:05 (22:05 and 23:05 UTC, so it is 00:05 in summer and in winter) | Post the month's fixed expenses (BR-136, D-93) |

  Every job is idempotent: running it twice on the same day changes nothing.

> ASSUMPTION (AS-21): The weekly backup runs on Sunday at 03:00 gym time, when the gym is closed.

- **BR-163 (weekly backup, D-F9):**
  - **Content:** every table of the gym's data (all tables in doc 07 §3, including `audit_log`, excluding Supabase Auth internals), exported as one CSV file per table. The CSVs are UTF-8 with a header row, dates as ISO `yyyy-mm-dd`, timestamps in ISO 8601 UTC. A `manifest.json` lists the tables, row counts, the schema migration version and the export time.
  - **Packaging:** all files go into one ZIP named `kpfitness-backup-<yyyy-mm-dd>.zip`, **encrypted with AES-256** using the password in the environment variable `BACKUP_ZIP_PASSWORD`.
  - **Storage:** the ZIP is uploaded to the private Storage bucket `backups`. Only the **8 most recent** backups are kept; older ones are deleted after a successful upload.
  - **Email:** sent to the gym setting `backup_emails` (default **`mihajlo@stamenkovicc.com`**), subject `Sedmična rezervna kopija – KP Fitness – <dd.mm.yyyy>`.
    - ZIP ≤ 35 MB: attached.
    - ZIP > 35 MB: not attached; the body says `Kopija je prevelika za email i sačuvana je u Supabase Storage (backups/<ime fajla>).`
  - **Failure:** the run is recorded as failed and retried on the next job runs, up to 3 attempts that day. The owner sees the last backup's date and status on S-27.
  - **Restore:** manual, by the developer, following the restore steps in the production guide (M-13).

> ASSUMPTION (AS-22): The backup ZIP is password-encrypted, because it contains members' personal data and travels by email.

> ASSUMPTION (AS-23): 8 backups are kept, and the 35 MB attachment limit applies (Resend allows 40 MB per email).
